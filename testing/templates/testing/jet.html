					<h2>Jet &amp; Rocket Propulsion Testing</h2>
					<p> Kelly Space &amp; Technology's (KST) indoor rocket test facility cost-effectively supports research and development (R&amp;D) and engine prototype testing on a commercial basis. The Jet &amp; Rocket Engine Test Site (JRETS) West facility can test rocket engines over a thrust range of 75 - 20,000 lbf (88,964 N) thrust. The test facility can support rapid prototyping and development activities for rocket engines to enable small business as well as larger organizations to conduct cost-effective propulsion component, subsystem and system level testing for commercial and government applications. </p>
					<p> The 18,000 square foot facility contains four separate test cells, two control rooms and two equipment rooms. Test Cells 1 and 2 are configured for rocket engine, systems and component testing. The test facility has supported (and is currently configured for) Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Methane propulsion systems. The facility can be modified to support LOX/LH2, LOX/RP and other engines using different propellant combinations. The facility is configured to use nitrogen or helium as the pressurization and purge gases; however, other options are possible. Larger propellant transfer and feed systems are located outside of the test facility and piped into the test cells. Smaller propellant systems may be installed in the test cells or directly onto the mobile test carts. Rocket engine feed systems within the cells are sized to meet specific test applications. Cell 3 is configured for either rocket or air-breathing systems and components. Cell 4 is configured for air-breathing engines and power plants. </p>
					<p>Our facility is configured to support a wide range of testing requirements through the use of mobile test carts. Mobile test carts provide the capability to assemble and build up test systems outside the test cells, while accommodating testing of other hardware within the test cells. In addition, each test cart is designed to facilitate a specific testing regime. Existing test carts are broken down into two different thrust classes: 0 &ndash; 3,000 lbf and 3,000 &ndash; 20,000 lbf thrust carts. </p>
