KST Content Management and Website Rebuild
===========================================

About this Project
------------------

The aim of the project is to develop a central codebase that can be used by future developers to quickly modify the front-end, back-end, and to create new web applications as needed. It will provide a central database for storing information necessary for user authentication, web applications, etc. To ensure future developers can easily maintain this project, the popular [**Python**](https://docs.python.org/3/) programming language was chosen.

This codebase utilizes the [**Django**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/) webframework, with built-in support for the [**Django Templating Language (DTL)**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/templates/) HTML templating engine. Website data is stored in a [**PostgreSQL**](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/) database. Manipulation of the database is done through the Django's built-in wrapper. Database migrations are done using [**Django Migrations**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/migrations/).

For easier styling, we will be using [**Bootstrap**](http://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.0.3/docs/css/), the most popular responsive, mobile friendly front-end framework available.  To ensure visual cohesion, developers are encouraged to use available templates already created and implemented.  Developers are advised to stick to the coding conventions and practices that are already used to ensure the project is extensible for all future developers.
